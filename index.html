        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This Project aims at visualizing the population of the 25 most densely populated cities in India currently, in the years 1971, 2001 and 2011, and using this information to analyze how the population has changed in various cities over the years.</p>
        <p>We used concentric circles of different colors to represent the population over different years. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Blue</strong></span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;">represents the population of <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">1971</span></strong>, </span><span><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Red</span>&nbsp;</strong></span>of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2001</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">Green</span> </strong>of <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">2011</span></strong>. The area of a circle is directly proportional to the population size it represents.</span></p>

    <section id='delhi'>
        <h3>New Delhi and Ghaziabad</h3>
        <p>The population of New Delhi increases rapidly between 1971 and 2001. From 2001 to 2011, the increase in population becomes much slower. An interesting correlation and possibly an effect of this can be seen on the neighbouring city of Ghaziabad whose population increases rapidly from 2001 to 2011.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='mumbai'>
        <h3>Mumbai and Thane</h3>
        <p>The population of Mumbai increases rapidly between 1971 and 2001. From 2001 to 2011, the increase in population is almost negligible. A similar interesting correlation and a possible effect of this can be seen on the neighbouring Thane whose population increase is much more substantial from 2001 to 2011.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='pune'>
        <h3>Pune and Navi Pune</h3>
        <p>Navi Pune follows the pattern of other suburbs as it sees an increase in polulation after 2001 while the increase in population of Pune reduces substantisally.</p>
    </section>
	<section id='chennai'>
        <h3>Chennai</h3>
        <p>Chennai follows the same pattern as the other two metro cities of Delhi and Mumbai with population rapidly increasing between 1971 and 2001 and saturating after 2001.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='north1'>
        <h3>Jaipur, Agra, kanpur, Lucknow and Patna</h3>
        <p>Most other cities in the North see a relatively lower rate of increase after 2001, however it's higher compared to the metro cities.</p>

    </section>
	<section id='central'>
        <h3>Bhopal, Indore and Nagpur</h3>
        <p>Cities in Central India follow along the same pattern with a low rate of inrease in poplualtion from 2001 to 2011.</p>
    </section>
	<section id='gujarat'>
        <h3>Ahmedabad, Vadodra and Surat</h3>
        <p>Cities in Western India, specifically in Gujarat, see a considerable rise in popualation from 2001-2011, with an 11.94% increase in Ahmedabad and 10.07% increase in Surat with respect to 2001. This is in complete contrast to other non-metro cities we've seen so far.</p>
    </section>
	<section id='south1'>
        <h3>Hyderabad, Vishakhapatnam, Bengaluru, Coimbatore and Madurai</h3>
        <p> Most cities in Southern India witness a huge increase in the population with the population of Bangalore having almost doubled increasing from 4.3 million to 8.4 million in the 10 years. Again, this is opposite to what is happening in the North.</p>

        <h3>Kolkata</h3>
        <p>In a stark conrast to every other city, we have viewed yet, the population here seems to have dramatically reduced in the period between 1961 and 2001. This owes to the fact that the city has been in a state of decline since 1967, before which it was considered to be the Business Capital of India, and befor Communism found its ground in the city, thereby reducing job oppoetunities. Thus more people are migrating away than are being born. This coupled with the Low fertility rates in the city has led to this unique reduction in population.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>There are some very clear and interesting trends that come out of this visualization:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>All metro cities' population has become saturated to some extent between 2001 to 2011, the rate of change of population isn't as significant as in other parts of the country, and the population is getting increasing faster in suburbs of these cities.</li>
        <li>Kolkata is the only city in the most populated cities whose population has decreased as compared to 1971.</li>
        <li>The rate of increase of population in the western and southern non-metro cities of the country is much significantly higher than in the northern and central cities. Our hypothesis is this could be because of the boom in the IT industry in the southern cities.</li>
