        <p>The population of New Delhi increases rapidly between 1971 to 2001. From 2001 to 2011, the increase in population becomes very slow and almost negligible. An interesting corelation and a possible effect of this can be seen on the neighbouring Ghaziabad whose population increases rapidly from 2001 to 2011. </p>
