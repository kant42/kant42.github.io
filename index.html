        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This Project aims at visualizing the population of the 25 most densely populated cities in India currently, in the years !971, 2001 and 2011, and using this information to analyse changes in the population density.</p>

    <section id='delhi'>
        <h3>New Delhi and Ghaziabad</h3>
        <p>The population of New Delhi increases rapidly between 1971 and 2001. From 2001 to 2011, the increase in population becomes very slow. An interesting corelation and a possible effect of this can be seen on the neighbouring Ghaziabad whose population increases rapidly from 2001 to 2011. </p>

        <p>The population of Mumbai increases rapidly between 1971 and 2001. From 2001 to 2011, the increase in population is almost almost negligible. A similar interesting corelation and a possible effect of this can be seen on the neighbouring Thane whose population increase is much more substantial from 2001 to 2011. </p>

	<section id='kolkata'>
        <h3>Kolkata</h3>
        <p>In a stark conrast to every other city, we have viewed yet, the population here seems to have dramatically reduced in the period between 1961 and 2001. This owes to the fact that the city has been in a state of decline since 1967, before which it was considered to be the Business Capital of India, and befor Communism found its ground in the city, thereby reducing job oppoetunities. Thus more people are migrating away than are being born. This coupled with the Low fertility rates in the city has led to this unique reduction in population.</p>
